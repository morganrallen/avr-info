avr-info
========
AVR Chip database scraped from avrfreaks.net

Provides database and scraper tool. Rescraping should not be needed as avrfreaks has
deprecated the their devices section and will not likely change. Although it is still
one of the more complete lists.

Notes

Flash is in kB all other memory types are Bytes.
